/* names.c - the top level's names in one hash index.
 *
 * Functions, globals, structs and enums, and macros share one namespace, and the built-in names are taken. A slot
 * holds a name once, with its number in each table that has it (-1 when that table does not), so finding a function
 * is a probe or a few instead of a walk over every function: compiling grew with the square of the number of
 * functions before. Open addressing with linear probing, FNV-1a; slots are never deleted - a failed REPL unit, which
 * takes names back, clears the index and fills it again from the tables (compile.c). The index starts small and
 * doubles (refilled from the tables) when it is half full: a hash puts every name on a page of its own, so a big
 * index would cost a page fault for each name. */
